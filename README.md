# What is Blueprint?

Neatly organized iOS.[sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) template with iPhone & iPad support.

### What is the story behind this?

"Should designers code?" No, I am not joking. The number of articles around this topic is incredible. The amount is so big that it got me questioning my own skills.

Am I able to do some coding or dev work? Will I be overrun by those incredibly skilled youngsters? I needed to know. I had a huge sketch template based on my experience from some really big projects. It sounded like a great idea to build a website around it and make it public.

So after a little bit of HTML, LESS, CoffeScript, [GSAP js](http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), Google Analytics, Git and SVG animation time I made this and I feel like a lot smarter guy already! Sure, it will take some time before I'll be able to use these tools effectively but it was a great learning experience.

Feel free to like it at [Dribbble](#) , give feedback at [Redpen](#) ([Mobile](#)), report bugs at [GitHub](#) or simply comment at [Designer News](#) :]

This website is made with <3 for the sake of learning.

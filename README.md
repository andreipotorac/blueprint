# What is Blueprint?

Blueprint is a simple sketch iOS template. It has all the stuff necessary for designing iOS apps right away.

## Why launch?

Launch was develop as a missing piece in our workflow here [@tapmates](http://tapmates.com/). I made it as we needed it to be.

## 70% less BS than in other templates

Blueprint has only the stuff necessary for developing iOS apps. Portrait and landscape views for both iPad and iPhone. Couple of switches and tabs, editable keyboard and thats it. All connected via symbols (I tried to make the symbols count as small as possible).

## 120% pixel perfect

All the pixels are aligned as they are in iOS 7.1.
